We will outline the day's agenda and introduce core skills for causal thinking. **Activity:** Discussion of typical causal questions in the study of religion and cooperation.\n\n\n09:30‚Äì10:35\nBasic Theory of Causality\n**Goal:** Cultivate skills in counterfactual thinking by introducing the potential outcomes framework. We will cover the intellectual history and the fundamental problem of causal inference. **Example:** Initial discussion of estimands, estimators, and estimates.\n\n\n10:35‚Äì10:50\nMorning Tea\n\n\n\n10:50‚Äì12:30\nSimulation-Based Inference\n**Goal:** Understand your causal system through simulation. Introduction to the EESI (Estimand, Estimator, Estimate, Simulation) workflow for organising projects. **Activity:** A worked example of simulation-based inference, followed by group discussion.\n\n\n12:30‚Äì13:30\nLunch\n\n\n\n13:30‚Äì15:00\nMapping Causal Systems (DAGs)\n**Goal:** Learn techniques for drawing and simulating causal systems using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Understand how to use theory, common sense, and metadata to build a DAG. **Activity:** Workshop on identifying confounds, colliders, instruments, and other biases. Introduction to `DAGitty` and simulations in `R`.\n\n\n15:00‚Äì15:15\nAfternoon Tea\n\n\n\n15:15‚Äì16:00\nControlling for Variables\n**Goal:** Develop a sense of which variables to worry about in causal inference. Distinguish between 'good,' 'bad,' and 'inconsequential' controls. **Activity:** Group exercises on evaluating control variables in example causal diagrams.\n\n\n16:00‚Äì16:45\nEstimating Causal Effects\n**Goal:** Learn introductory approaches to estimating causal effects. **Activity:** Overview of g-computation, inverse probability weighting (IPW), and doubly robust estimation. Discussion of sensitivity checks.\n\n\n16:45‚Äì17:00\nWrap-up & Discussion\n**Goal:** Consolidate the day's concepts. **Activity:** Q&A and open discussion about applying these methods to participants' work."
