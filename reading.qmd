## Required Reading

The following readings are recommended in **descending order of importance** for the workshop:

### 1. Thinking Clearly About Correlations and Causation

::: {.card}
**Rohrer, J. M. (2018)**. Thinking clearly about correlations and causation: Graphical causal models for observational data. *Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science*, 1(1), 27-42.

ðŸ“– [https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917745629](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917745629)

**Why this matters:** This paper provides an excellent introduction to causal diagrams (DAGs) and how they help us think about causation in observational data. Essential reading for understanding the core concepts we'll use throughout the workshop.
:::

### 2. Causality in the Study of Religion

::: {.card}
**Major-Smith, D. (2023)**. Exploring causality from observational data: An example assessing whether religiosity promotes cooperation. *Evolutionary Human Sciences*, 5, e22.

ðŸ“– [https://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2023.17](https://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2023.17)

**Why this matters:** A practical application of causal inference methods to a key question in the study of religion. This paper demonstrates the workflow we'll be learning.
:::

### 3. The Data Analyst's Guide (Chapters 1-4)

::: {.card}
**Bendixen, T, and Purzycki, B. G. (forthcoming)**. *The Data Analyst's Guide to Cause and Effect*. London: SAGE. 

ðŸ“š **Chapters 1-4** (Day 1 will largely follow Chapters 1-2)

**Why this matters:** Our primary textbook for the workshop. These chapters introduce the fundamental concepts and practical approaches we'll be using.

*Note: Materials will be provided to workshop participants.*

## Conceptual Foundations

### Key Concepts to Review

Before the workshop, it will be helpful to be familiar with these statistical concepts:

::: {.card}
#### Basic Statistics
- **Correlation** vs **Causation**
- **Regression analysis** basics
- **Confounding variables**
- **Selection bias**

#### Research Design
- **Observational** vs **Experimental** data
- **Counterfactual thinking**
- **Treatment and control groups**
:::

## Questions to Consider

As you read, consider these questions about your own research:

::: {.rainbow-text style="font-size: 1.2rem;"}
âœ¨ What causal questions about religion and cooperation interest you?
:::

1. What is your **outcome** of interest?
2. What is your **treatment** or exposure?
3. What **confounders** might bias your analysis?
4. What **data** would you need to answer your question?
5. How would you **communicate** your findings?
