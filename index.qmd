# Welcome to SPARCC Day 1! üåà

**Building Foundations for Causal Thinking in the Study of Religion and Cooperation**

Tuesday, 12 August 2025 | 09:00 ‚Äì 17:00
:::

## Workshop Overview

This workshop introduces the fundamental concepts and practical skills for causal inference in observational data. We'll explore how to move beyond correlation to understand causation in the study of religion and cooperation.

    "",
    "**Goal:** Understand your causal system through simulation. Introduction to the EESI (Estimand, Estimator, Estimate, Simulation) workflow for organising projects.\n**Activity:** A worked example of simulation-based inference, followed by group discussion.",
    "",
    "**Goal:** Learn techniques for drawing and simulating causal systems using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Understand how to use theory, common sense, and metadata to build a DAG.\n**Activity:** Workshop on identifying confounds, colliders, instruments, and other biases. Introduction to `DAGitty` and simulations in `R`.",
    "",
    "**Goal:** Develop a sense of which variables to worry about in causal inference. Distinguish between 'good,' 'bad,' and 'inconsequential' controls.\n**Activity:** Group exercises on evaluating control variables in example causal diagrams.",
    "**Goal:** Learn introductory approaches to estimating causal effects.\n**Activity:** Overview of g-computation, inverse probability weighting (IPW), and doubly robust estimation. Discussion of sensitivity checks.",
    "**Goal:** Consolidate the day's concepts.\n**Activity:** Q&A and open discussion about applying these methods to participants' work."

### üéØ Core Skills

1. **Think causally** about correlations in observational data
2. **Draw and interpret** causal diagrams (DAGs)
3. **Identify** confounders, colliders, and other sources of bias
4. **Apply** the EESI workflow to structure research projects
5. **Select** appropriate control variables for causal analyses
6. **Understand** basic estimation approaches (g-computation, IPW, doubly robust methods)

## What You'll Need

::: {.callout-tip}
### Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with statistical concepts (regression, correlation)
- Interest in causal questions about religion and cooperation
- No prior causal inference experience required!
:::

::: {.callout-note}
### Materials to Bring
- Laptop with R and RStudio installed (optional but helpful)
- Your research questions about religion and cooperation
- Enthusiasm for collaborative learning!
:::

## Workshop Philosophy

This workshop emphasizes **learning by doing**. We'll work through practical examples, engage in group exercises, and apply concepts to real research questions in the study of religion and cooperation.
